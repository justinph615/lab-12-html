Welcome to My Home Page

I've thought about making a comic book style website where each comic book panel box would be black and white until someone hovers over the boxes and makes the colors show. Might make reading a comic book easier because you're interacting with color of the drawings and text with a mouse hover.

Another idea for my homepage would be to make a short playlist of my favorite songs and have it preloaded on the webpage so that and user can click play and pause whenever they want. Might also be a random homepage with mixture of elements I want to show.

Whatever the idea is, the color of my webpages would be dark mode inspired, so the backgrounds would be darker than the conventional white webpages seen on most mainstream websites.
