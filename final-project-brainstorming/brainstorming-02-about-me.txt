My name is Justin Philip although my google name is Justin Space. Some people think Philip is my first name since I have 2 first names that's why I chose to change my last name to Space on my  google account. My previous work experience is nothing major. Just did some retail work and worked for Amazon. I have been in college for exactly ten years. I started in Spring of 2011, going from BMCC to NYIT to City College, back to BMCC to finish my accociates, then finally to City Tech where I am planning to get my Bachelor's in Emerging Media Technology. I currently have over 150 credits, but need the required classes to graduate. The work I've been doing in this school has been great. Every semester, I have created something I'm proud of, whether its with arduino, processing, unity or digital fabrication. I'm also a person who stutters, something I've been dealing with since childhood. It ranges from moderate to serve at times and I have to change some words around when talking verbally. I've done speech therapy and have to remind myself to use some techniques when experiencing a block. Hopefully in the future, if I go back to speech therapy, I'll be able to overcome my stutter and achieve my goals of starting a tech business and get Americans back to work post-pandemic.
